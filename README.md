# APS-SCANIA-FAILURE

* It involves the data set consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage.
* The datasets' positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system.
* The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS and both types of failure cost different amount to the company. In this project different machine learning models like logistic regression , Support vector machine, KNN method and Random forest are used and optimized to accurately predict and minimize the cost of failure.
